## STORY : 
"You live in the magnificent realm of Balland.
Since childhood, you've always been laughed by the other ballizens !
For you are a very special being.
Contrary to your peers, you were born different. Unique.
For an unknown reason, some strange particles are emitted by your body and have been given you special abilities.
You used to be ashamed of your difference. But that was before. Before Megaball invaded CityBall!
Thanks to your special abilities, try to save the kidnapped ballizens and defeat the awful Megaball !
Hurry ! Everyone's counting on you Superball !" 


## EXPLANATION :
The purpose of the game is to collect a certain number of colorful balls in a limited amount of time. 
(You can set the amount of time as well as the number of balls you need to save to win the game.)

To do so, the player should try to collide as many as possible colorful balls. Combos make your ball go faster while colliding dark balls make you lose your speed and a life point !
The dark balls are underlings sent by Megaball to stop you ! Beware of them !

( A piece of advice : in order to avoid enemies, you can always jump ðŸ˜‰ )

You can replay as much as you want to !

## LEVELS AND THEIR SPECIFICATIONS :
- LEVEL 1 : it is an easy level. By pressing space, the ball can jump. The enemies are moving randomly and if you touch one them you will lose a life point !
- LEVEL 2 :  it is a more difficult level in which a special enemy appears, a mystery box that will try to follow you if you stand too close to it! It will make you lose 2 balls that you already saved (you will need to save this ball again). After colliding with you, this box wil teleport itself somewhere else in the world. 
- LEVEL 3 : it is the final stage. You will be fighting directly against the awful megaball ! You must throw at him as many balls as possible to exhaust him (by pressing enter). Beware, for each collision with megaball, you will lose a life point !
- As you have a limited amount of time to finish the level, there are teleportation gates that will help you seek for balls in distress faster ! There are also bonuses that will give you a life point when there is a collision with yout ball !

## BUGS 
- Sometimes the scene isn't loaded properly so there's a dark blue screen. After many attempts to solve this problem we have not found a solution. Thus, you need to refresh the page until the scene is loaded properly.
- Also, as the scene isn't always loaded properly, we advise you to wait a few seconds before to start a level. Indeed, sometimes some balls are going though the ground. 
- Finally, note that after touching a black enemy, it's sometimes not possible to eat one of the colored balls. In this case, you should try to eat the other balls to resolve this issue.
